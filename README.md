# pixy 2.0
pixy is a command-line tool for painlessly estimating average nucleotide diversity within (π) and between (dxy) populations from a VCF. In particular, pixy facilitates the use of VCFs containing invariant (monomorphic) sites, which are essential for the correct computation of π and dxy in the face of missing data (i.e. always).

This project focus on expanding pixy's capability to handle data from polyploid species.
